        Hello, my name is PaperMountain.
        \n\n I am really hardworking, i wish to become fit one day, but i kept on eating junk food. I feel that i lack discipline.
        Sometimes I wish that i can have more brainpower to think for code. I am sure that with more practice, i can do it.
        \n\nCurrently, i am learning Android Dev for my school project. It feels that i wasted the last term trying to learn from the teacher
        because the materials on Java is really not enough at all, especially the android programming portion.
        \n\nI get stressed up easily
        because of my personality and some previous bad habits that i have built up since secondary school. It has been affecting me alot,
        its time to change it! I am sure that i can do this.
